---

I'm looking for a developer to subcontract some client work to. The work I would be giving to you is low complexity, but often time consuming, python / front end tasks. It's suitable for a junior dev who would need mentoring to help finish the tasks, a senior dev with some time on their hands, or anything in between.

The project you would be working on is a data driven django site. The back end is a postgres database with a few thousand entries of client curated data. The front end is mostly a series of graphs used to display that data.

## Tasks

I'll be working primarily on graphs, operations, and communicating expectation and progress with the client. You'll be working on getting the data into the database, and the non-graph portions of the front end.

Your main tasks will be:

- (python) copy a 5000 row spreadsheet with references to currently existing database objects to the database
- (python) same task as above, but with roughly 1000 images that need to be copied to an image server
- (front end) implement the static / info page portions of the front end
- (front end) implement a simple django CMS for editing the text pages

## $$$

**$30/hr**, up to $1500 ~ $3000

You tell me your hours worked, I pay you, and then invoice the client with my + your hours.

I'll want to know your hours weekly, and you should work a **maximum of 20 hours / $600** in a week. I'll make sure to always have $600 ready to pay you with, and if that's ever not the case I will let you know immediately.

## Time commitment

I expect you to work on this project for a **minimum of 5 hours a week**. I'll also need you to be available at least 1 day a week at 7pm - 10pm PST to pair with me.

There's a **flexible end of August deadline** for the full body of work. You are under no obligation to work until that time, but I would prefer someone who can.

If you are unable to continue working with me (illness, scheduling conflicts, etc) or can't work for a week just let me know ASAP.

## Extra info

- we'll be using Gitlab + Trello + Slack for collaboration
- the site is hosted on Heroku
- the project is a "set it and forget" one, so there's no expectation of test coverage / documentation

## This sound like work you want?
