About:

The majority of my work experience is split between writing Python, Ruby, and CSS. I currently work some nights and weekends with [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/), helping maintain Bundler and RubyGems via a variety of project management and Ruby development tasks. Ruby Together is a small non-profit focused on getting funding and support to Ruby's technical infrastructure, and is a relatively small time commitment (5 hours / week). Previously I worked on [Harlot Magazine](http://harlot.media/), working primarily on implementing the front-end in combination was a designer, and secondarily on upkeeping the website's backend via PHP and bash scripts. Finally, my current career started with working on [Quirell](https://gitlab.com/collectqt/quirell) a social network prototype written in Python + Flask, running on a graph database (Neo4j).

My other work includes - talks at [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1608) about my social network prototype, and at [Alterconf](http://www.alterconf.com/speakers/lynn-cyrin) about how software design informs culture. I also write about the intersections of tech and social norms at [ModelViewCulture](https://modelviewculture.com/authors/lynn-cyrin) and my personal site. Finally, I work tools like [Twitter Mute Till Election](https://twitter.com/lynncyrin/status/720841089641394177) and [TumblrDevKit](https://github.com/LynnCo/TumblrDevKit). All of my other projects you can find listed on my [Github](https://github.com/LynnCo) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/u/cyrin) accounts.
