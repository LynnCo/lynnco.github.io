Lynn "Cyrin" Conway, [pronoun.is/she](http://pronoun.is/she), black trans lesbian, ruby / python web developer, project manager, activist

My cultural work is with social tech, like [Mute Till Election](https://twitter.com/lynncyrin/status/720841089641394177), [Quirell](http://gitlab.com/collectqt/quirell), and [TheBlockBot](http://theblockbot.herokuapp.com). My work $$$ working with [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/) for about 5 hours a week, doing project management for it, Bundler, and RubyGems. A lot of my income is crowdfunded via [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lynncyrin), through very generous people who want me to keep up my work!

On any given day I'm probably on Twitter, maybe writing Ruby / Python / CSS, and possibly helping organize work on [bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler) or [rubygems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems)
