I'm Lynn "Cyrin" Conway ([pronoun.is/she](http://pronoun.is/she)) full-stack web developer and project manager. Currently looking for full / part time web development positions that are remote or in Portland, Oregon.

Top Skills:

- Rails, Flask

About Me:

Python, Ruby, and CSS form the majority of my work experience. I currently work nights and weekends with [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/), maintaining Bundler and RubyGems. My work with Ruby Together is roughly 5 hours a week of project management and Ruby coding. I worked on [Harlot Magazine](http://harlot.media/), an internet magazine utilizing Craft CMS. Harlot was a front end development job, supplemented by some PHP / bash scripting. My career started with founding and managing a [social network prototype](https://gitlab.com/collectqt/quirell). That prototype is in Python + Flask, running on a graph database (Neo4j).

Some of my smaller projects include - a talk at [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1608) about my social network prototype. A talk at [Alterconf](http://www.alterconf.com/speakers/lynn-cyrin) about how software design informs culture. Writing about the intersections of tech and social norms at [ModelViewCulture](https://modelviewculture.com/authors/lynn-cyrin) and my [personal site](http://lynncyrin.me). Finally, tools like [Twitter Mute Till Election](https://twitter.com/lynncyrin/status/720841089641394177) and [TumblrDevKit](https://github.com/LynnCo/TumblrDevKit). All my other projects you can find listed on my [Github](https://github.com/LynnCo) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/u/cyrin) accounts. My [resume](http://lynncyrin.me/resume.pdf) goes into more detail.
