Lynn Cyrin
Professional full stack web developer with 2 years of industry experience working in multifunctional roles
on self-sufficient, agile teams. Looking for work in Portland, Oregon or remote.
My nontechnical work revolves around community, access, identity, and diversity. The majority of this work
